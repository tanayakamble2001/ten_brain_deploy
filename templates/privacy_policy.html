        Data is seen as an asset that has to be safeguarded against loss and

        prevent members both inside and outside the company from gaining
        unauthorized access to such data. To safeguard the personal data
        that is provided to us and the data that we access, we adhere to
        well recognized industry standards.

        We have put in place the organizational and technological safeguards
        that are appropriate and required to protect your personal data, and
        all of the information we receive about you is kept on secure
        servers. We regularly assess the network's security and the
        effectiveness of its internal information security program, which
        aims to:

      <ol>
        <li>
          assist in protecting your data against unintentional or illegal
          loss, access, or disclosure;
